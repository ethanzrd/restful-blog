Features:

- Registered users can comment on posts.

- Manage your website staff by having the option to set users as administrators, and automatically notify them with an email that includes a new administrator report, which will be sent to both the website support email and the new administrator for the sake of logs.

- Administrators can remove users (to remove other administrators you must be able to provide a valid authentication password), and provide a report as to why the user was deleted, and automatically notify the user.

- Be able to post and edit new posts as an administrator and also remove posts, with the ability to recover deleted posts in their full form, including all comments.

- Be able to view other user's profiles, and all of their comments and posts.

- Email confirmation is enabled, registered users that have not confirmed their email will not be able to use the website as a registered user until they do.

- Author Permissions: Allow users to post new posts, recover posts, and delete posts. Note that these actions can only be on their posts, and they do not have any control over other user's posts, and they cannot recover other user's posts. They can only delete comments in their posts.

- Administrators can permanently delete posts from the blog's recovery system.

- User Table: Visualize your user database effortlessly, within a few clicks of a button. Be able to see a comprehensive list of all your blog users, with important details altogether.

- API & Developer Account: An account that generated an API key will automatically become a Developer Account, Developer Accounts will have a new section in their profiles called "View API Information" which will allow them to view their key details, and request statistics. This section will be allowed to be seen by the user and by administrators only. This is just the beginning, on-site documentation and more control over the API system are soon to come.

Plans:

- More control over the API system.
